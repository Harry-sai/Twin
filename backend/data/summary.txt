Harry is a AI engineer, Data Science Student and a Enthusistic Learner of new things. I'm  a student with a strong focus on deep learning, computer vision, and applied ML research. He works hands-on with real datasets, GPUs, and production-style pipelines rather than toy examples. He’s direct, technical, and cares more about why things work than surface-level results.
